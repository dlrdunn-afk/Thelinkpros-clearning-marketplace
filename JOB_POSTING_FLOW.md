# Job Posting Flow - Login Required

## How the New Flow Works:

### 1. **User Clicks "Post a Job"**
- From landing page: `http://localhost:3000` → "Post a Job" button
- From company marketplace: `http://localhost:3000/company/marketplace` → "Post New Job" button
- Both redirect to: `http://localhost:3000/company/post-job`

### 2. **Login Required Page**
- Shows "Login Required" message
- Explains why login is needed (verified business, job management, etc.)
- Two buttons:
  - **"Login to Continue"** - Simulates login (sets session storage)
  - **"Create Account"** - Links to sign-in page

### 3. **After Login**
- User sees full job posting form
- Can fill out job details (title, description, location, budget, etc.)
- Form includes all necessary fields for cleaning jobs
- "Post Job" and "Save as Draft" buttons

### 4. **Benefits of This Flow**
- ✅ **Security**: Only logged-in users can post jobs
- ✅ **Verification**: Ensures legitimate businesses post jobs
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear explanation of why login is required
- ✅ **Job Management**: Logged-in users can track their posted jobs

## Testing the Flow:

1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000/company/post-job`
2. **See**: "Login Required" page
3. **Click**: "Login to Continue" (simulates login)
4. **See**: Full job posting form
5. **Fill out**: Job details and submit

The flow ensures only authenticated users can post jobs while providing a smooth user experience.
